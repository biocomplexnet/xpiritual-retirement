The hotel has 10 rooms for a maximum of 30 people. Each room has a bedroom and its own bathroom including a shower. If by the moment of your registration Hotel Posada Yolihuani is fully booked, we have the possibility to get rooms in another hotel (Mesón San Antonio).

# Scientific Program

It is desirable for every participant to present his/her scientific work. This is not a burden but a good chance to present your scientific results in order to connect with people that may be interested in your topic. If you're a member of the Bioinformatics & Complex Networks Lab, your presentation is mandatory. We will have two kinds of talks: 

- **Regular talk:** 15 minutes talk + 5 minutes questions

- **Extended talk (1 per day):** 30 minutes talk + 10 minutes questions 

A meaningful (preliminary) title should be given at the registration process in order to schedule talk sessions. As usual, we provide a video projector (with VGA & HDMI port) and a laser pointer for the presentations. 

Further information on the time table will be given at time.
